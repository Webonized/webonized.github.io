- `build:watch` Build the page with active file watcher. *(recommended)*
- `build:dev` Build the page for development (without optimization like minification).
- `build:dev:watch` Build the page for development (without optimization like minification) with active file watcher.
- `serve` *Not implemented yet (currently does nothing)*
